        <h2>Overview:</h2>
        <p>Abortion is the deliberate termination of a pregnancy prior to 24 weeks gestation (after conception). It is
          sometimes called 'termination of pregnancy'. Around 73 million abortions take place every year. 6 out of 10
          (61%) of unintended pregnancies, and 3 out of 10 (29%) of all pregnancies, end in abortion.</p>
        <p>About 45% of abortions, however, are unsafe, and 97% of these abortions take place in developing countries.

        <h2>Law in the UK:</h2>
        <p>Abortion became legal in England, Wales and Scotland for up to 24 weeks gestation following the 1967 Abortion
          Act. It is still, however, illegal in Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p>Abortion must be performed in a registered clinic/hospital, and it must be agreed upon by 2 doctors.</p>

          <h2>How to get an abortion:</h2>
          <p>There are 2 main types of abortion: Medical abortion and Surgical abortion</p>
          <h3>Medical Abortion:</h3>
          <p>A medical abortion involves taking 2 medicines to end the pregnancy. These are prescribed by the hospital
            or
            clinic and are usually taken up to 10 weeks gestation.</p>
        </div>
        <img src="images/background-image.png" alt="medical abortion" />
      </div>
      <p>First, the woman is given a tablet called mifepristone, which prepares the body for the next medication.
      </p>
      <p>Usually 1 or 2 days later, the woman is then given another medicine called misoprostol. Within 4-6 hours,
        the lining of the womb breaks down, causing pain and bleeding, and the pregnancy passes out of the woman's
        body
        through the vagina. </p>
      <h3>Surgical Abortion:</h3>
      <p>Surgical abortion involves an operation/procedure to remove the pregnancy from the womb. It is done
        with either local anaesthetic, conscious sedation or deep sedation/general anaesthetic.</p>
      <p>There are 2 possible procedures for a surgical abortion:</p>
      <li>Vacuum/Suction aspiration: This can be done up to 14 weeks gestation. It involves inserting a tube through the
        cervix and removing the pregnancy using suction. This takes around 5-10 minutes, and the woman can
        usually go home pretty much straight after.</li>
      <li>Dilatation and Evacuation: This involves inserting an instrument called forceps into the womb through the
        cervix
        to remove the pregnancy. This is used after 14 weeks gestation, and is done under general anaesthetic or
        sedation. The operation takes around 10-20 minutes, and the woman can usually go home the same day.</li>
