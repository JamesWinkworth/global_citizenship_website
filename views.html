        <h2>Overview:</h2>
        <p>Abortion is a very divided topic. Many people believe that abortion is a mother's way of taking control of
          her body, and it gives her the freedom to do what she wants. Other people, however, believe in a pro-life view
          that life starts at conception, and therefore abortion is murder and should be banned, because only God is
          allowed to take life.</p>
        <p>Reasons people choose to have an abortion may include:</p>
        <li>To save the mother or child's life</li>
        <li>Risk of severe disability</li>
        <li>The mother isn't financially stable</li>
        <li>Rape/sexual assault</li>

          <li>There are alternatives to abortion e.g. adoption or legal guardianship, as well as ways to prevent it e.g.
            contraception.</li>
          <li>Abortion destroys human life, making life seem cheap and expendable.</li>
          <li>People born with disabilities can still live happy lives.</li>
          <li>Everyone, including an embryo or foetus, has a right to live, which abortion takes away.</li>

      <h2>Religious Views:</h2>
      <div class="religious-container">
        <div>
          <h3>Christianity:</h3>
          <p>On the whole, Christians oppose abortion, most notably Roman Catholics. They believe in the 'sanctity of
            life', which states that all life is a gift from God and is sacred. However, some Christians may accept
            abortion under certain circumstances,
            e.g. if the mother's life is at risk. Regarding abortion, the General Synod stated: <q>The Church of England
              combines strong opposition to abortion with a recognition that there can be - strictly limited -
              conditions
              under which it may be morally preferable to any available alternative.</q></p>

          <h3>Islam:</h3>
          <p>Similar to Christians, Muslims believe in the 'sancity of life', and that all life is sacred and should
            be
            protected. The Qur'an states: <q>Whosoever has spared the life of a soul, it is as though he has spared
              the
              life of all people. Whosoever has killed a soul, it is as though he has murdered all of mankind</q>.
            However,
            many Muslims may accept circumstances for abortion because it may be seen as the 'lesser of two evils',
            meaning the least evil compared to alternatives.</p>

          <h3>Buddhism:</h3>
          <p>Traditional Buddhism is very opposed to abortion, as it meets the 5 conditions required to constitute the
            act
            of killing. However, as with other religions, more modern buddhists think it depends on the situation, with
            the Dalai Lama stating: <q>Of course, abortion, from a Buddhist viewpoint, is an act of killing ... but it
              depends on the circumstances. If the unborn child will be retarded or if the birth will create serious
              problems for the parent, these are cases where there can be an exception. I think abortion should be
              approved
              or disapproved according to each circumstance.</q></p>

        <div style="order: 2;">
          <h3>Judaism:</h3>
          <p>Strict Judaism permits abortion only when it poses a threat to the mother's life. This includes if she is
            at
            risk of death, or if the mother may be in distress, as well as if she was a victim of rape/incest. Other
            than
            that, abortion is not permitted, as Judaism has a very strict view about the sancity of life. According to
            the
            Mishnah: <q>Whoever destroys one life is as if he destroyed a whole world, and whoever preserves a life is
              as
              if he preserved the whole world.</q></p>

          <h3>Hinduism:</h3>
          <p>Hindu views stem from the idea of 'ahimsa', meaning non-violence. This means that Hindus are generally very
            opposed to abortion, unless it is to save the life of the mother. One Hindu text compared abortion
            to
            the killing of a priest, and another one said that abortion is an even worse sin than killing the parents.
